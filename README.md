# Portfilio Site

Created to replace my older portfolio site.

The idea eventually is to have projects and other bits I have done uploaded to it.

## Automation

As part of my DevOps journey, I want to get GitHub actions setup for this site, to automate deployment to my servers (and eventually Kubernetes cluster).

## Design

Using Khroma[khroma.co], I was able to get some colour schemes I liked. From there, I have used Figma to mock up a design that is pleasing to me. I am sure it will further develop over time.
