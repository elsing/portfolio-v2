Check out my first post...

Hey there!

I’ve finally gotten around to building a proper home for all the stuff I’ve been tinkering with — projects, setups, experiments, and (eventually) tutorials. Basically, a place where I can share what I’ve been working on, and maybe help someone else along the way.

Why a new site? Well, I’ve been juggling a bunch of small projects across different platforms, and it was getting messy keeping everything in separate repos or notes. This site is my attempt to bring it all together — a single place to track, show, and explore the things I care about.

Right now, it’s mostly a landing page, but I’m already working on the projects area, where you’ll be able to see what I’ve built and even peek behind the curtain at how it works. Eventually, I plan to post tutorials about some of my setups — like Traefik + Docker + Ansible deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and other fun infra experiments.

This blog is my space to be honest and conversational about tech — the wins, the mess-ups, the things that worked surprisingly well, and the things that didn’t. I’m hoping it’ll be a mix of insights for fellow tech enthusiasts and a look at what goes on behind the scenes for anyone curious.

So, this is just the first post — consider it me waving 👋 and saying, “Hey, I’m here, and I’ve got some things to show.” Stick around if you’re into tinkering, learning, or just watching someone experiment with tech in a friendly, no-fluff way.

Next up: diving into some projects and tutorials. Can’t wait to get stuck in.

P.S - yes this was written by AI, I plan on changing this.
